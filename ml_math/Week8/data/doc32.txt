 Now some people will say to me  Joe  I liked the Da Vinci code  you re being too hard on Dan Brown 
  I love the da vinci code   
  Well I did enjoy Bridget Jones and I loved the Da Vinci Code so this idea appeals to me and it takes Chick Lit into one of the few arenas that the genre has yet to explore   
  I just read Da Vinci Code   which was AWESOME by the way     
  The Da Vinci Code is excellent if you read it as normal as you read other novels     
  I loved the Da Vinci Code 
  I love reading The Da Vinci Code    
  I m telling you  the Da Vinci Code is an AWESOME book 
  Then again  my opinion may be a bit biased because I loved the Da Vinci Code soundtrack    
  And I was quite pleased with my own open mindedness  after having loved The Da Vinci Code so much  that I was able to get equal enjoyment  seeing how the other side reads
